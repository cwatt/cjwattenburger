### Research Background

#### PhD: Measuring *in-situ* bacterial growth and death to understand soil carbon cycling

Watch my exit seminar [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sN2BtTGmww&list=FLViexQIG-lgbwcKNEjMNgEw&index=2&ab_channel=CornellSIPS) (or below)!

For my PhD research in the [Buckley lab](https://blogs.cornell.edu/buckley/) at Cornell, I measured in-situ bacterial growth and death in soils for individual taxa. Bacterial growth is closely tied with metabolism, which drives organic matter decomposition and, by extension, the soil carbon (C) cycle. Dead microbes make up up to 80% of persistent C in most soils, so we were also interested in death. I used this data to predict microbial traits from growth and death patterns and to explore how microbial community dynamics impact C cycling in soils.

#### MS: Impacts of agricultural management on rhizosphere microbial communities

<img src="marsden2.png" align="left" alt="Marsden fieldsite." style="width:35%" HSPACE="20" VSPACE="10"/>

I did my MS at Iowa State University co-advised between the [Halverson](https://www.plantpath.iastate.edu/people/larry-halverson) and [Hofmockel](http://kirstenhofmockel.org/) labs. There, I took advantage of the [Marsden long-term rotation site](https://www.cals.iastate.edu/inrc/marsden-long-term-rotation-study) (see left)  to investigate how agricultural management effects maize root-associated microbial communities, with a particular emphasis on taxa important for nitrogen cycling.

#### Internships at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory

I interned at the [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/) in [Dr. Vanessa Bailey's lab](https://www.pnnl.gov/science/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=5776) each summer during my undergraduate years. I learned the basics of experimental design, research conduct, and various methods commonly used in microbial ecology thanks to Sarah Fansler, lab manager extraordinaire. I worked on various projects, including comparing bacterial and fungal respiration in agricultural soils, developing a DNA extraction technique for individual soil aggregates, and the effect of gradual warming on soil community exo-metabolite production.
