#### PhD: In-situ bacterial growth rates and soil C cycling

For my PhD research in the Buckley lab at Cornell, I'm measuring in-situ bacterial growth in soils for individual taxa. Bacterial growth is closely tied with bacterial metabolism, and drives organic matter decomposition and, by extension, the soil carbon cycle. I'm using this data to predict microbial traits from growth patterns and explore how microbial community growth dynamics impact C cycling in soils.

#### MS: Impacts of agricultural management on rhizosphere microbial communities

<img src="marsden2.png" align="left" alt="Marsden fieldsite." style="width:35%" HSPACE="20" VSPACE="10"/>

I did my MS at Iowa State University co-advised between the [Halverson](https://www.plantpath.iastate.edu/people/larry-halverson) and [Hofmockel](http://kirstenhofmockel.org/) labs. There, I took advantage of the [Marsden long-term rotation site](https://www.cals.iastate.edu/inrc/marsden-long-term-rotation-study) (see left)  to investigate how agricultural management effects maize root-associated microbial communities, with a particular emphasis on taxa important for nitrogen acquisition.

#### Internships at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory

I interned at the [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/) each summer during my undergraduate years in [Dr. Vanessa Bailey's lab](https://www.pnnl.gov/science/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=5776). Here, I learned the basics of experimental design, research conduct, and various methods commonly used in microbial ecology. I worked on various projects, including comparing bacterial and fungal respiration in agricultural soils, developing a DNA extraction technique for individual soil aggregates, and the effect of gradual warming on soil community exo-metabolite production.
