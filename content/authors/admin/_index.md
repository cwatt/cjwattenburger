I'm Cassi (she/her), a PhD candidate in the Soil Science program at Cornell University. I work in the {{< staticref "http://blogs.cornell.edu/buckley/" "newtab" >}}Buckley lab{{< /staticref >}} where I'm researching the role of microbial life history traits in the soil carbon cycle. I'm broadly interested in the role of microbial communities in soil and plant health and am looking for career opportunities that will let me leverage my data science skills, and microbiology and soils expertise to make positive changes in agriculture or the life sciences industry.
