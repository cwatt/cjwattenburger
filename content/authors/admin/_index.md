I'm Cassi (she/her), a PhD candidate in the Soil Science program at Cornell University. I work in the {{< staticref "http://blogs.cornell.edu/buckley/" "newtab" >}}Buckley lab{{< /staticref >}} where I'm researching the role of microbial life history traits in the soil carbon cycle. I use next generation sequencing and bioinformatics to see the unseen. I'm broadly interested in the role of microbial communities in soil and plant health.
